# Text Adventure Creation

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for creating interactive text adventures using Inky! This repository contains my journey into the world of interactive fiction, where I blend storytelling and programming to create immersive narrative experiences.

## General Approach

### Planning the Story
1. **Conceptualization**: I start with a basic idea or theme for the story. This includes defining the setting, main plot points, and key characters.
2. **Plot Outline**: I draft an outline of the story, including major events and how they unfold. This helps me stay organized and ensures a coherent narrative flow.

### Writing the Story
1. **Scenes and Interactions**: I break down the story into smaller scenes and define the interactions players can have within each scene. Each scene corresponds to a part of the narrative where the player can make choices.
2. **Choices and Consequences**: For each interaction, I create multiple choices for the player, each leading to different outcomes. This adds depth and replayability to the story.

### Coding in Inky
1. **Story Flow**: Using Inky, I structure the story flow with nodes representing different scenes and choices.
2. **Variables and Conditions**: I utilize variables to track player decisions and conditionals to branch the story based on these decisions.
3. **Testing and Iteration**: Continuous testing ensures that the story flows as intended and that all branches work correctly. Feedback and iterations help refine the narrative.

## This Project: The Job Interview Adventure

### Overview
In this text adventure, you play the role of an interviewer conducting a job interview. You have a selection of questions to choose from, and based on the candidate's responses, you decide whether to hire them. The candidate's answers can reveal hidden traits, adding an intriguing twist to the narrative.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Question Pool**: You have a large pool of questions, but only a subset is presented in each playthrough, ensuring variability and replayability.
- **Branching Storyline**: The candidate's responses and your choices lead to different paths and outcomes, making each playthrough unique.
- **Interactive Decisions**: Your decisions affect the flow of the story and the final outcome, making the player an active participant in the narrative.

### How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Begin by selecting "Start the interview" to initiate the story.
2. **Ask Questions**: Choose from a list of questions to ask the candidate. Each question will prompt a unique response.
3. **Make Decisions**: Based on the candidate's responses, decide whether to hire them or not.
4. **Experience the Outcome**: See the consequences of your decisions and the hidden traits revealed by the end of the interview.
