## First Project: The Job Interview Adventure https://kellydrasmussen.github.io/text_adventures/

### Overview
In this text adventure, you play the role of an interviewer conducting a job interview. You have a selection of questions to choose from, and based on the candidate's responses, you decide whether to hire them. The candidate's answers can reveal hidden traits.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Question Pool**: You have a large pool of questions, but only a subset is presented in each playthrough, ensuring variability and replayability.
- **Interactive Decisions**: Your decisions affect the flow of the story and the final outcome, making the player an active participant in the narrative.

### How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Begin by selecting "Start the interview" to initiate the story.
2. **Ask Questions**: Choose from a list of questions to ask the candidate. Each question will prompt a unique response.
3. **Make Decisions**: Based on the candidate's responses, decide whether to hire them or not.
4. **Experience the Outcome**: See the consequences of your decisions and the hidden traits revealed by the end of the interview.
